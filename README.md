# Who Ate My Cookies (RS)

This is a Rust port of my Global Game Jam (2015) game, [Who Ate My Cookies](https://bsurmanski.itch.io/who-ate-my-cookies-ggj15).
This was ported so that I could compile it to WebASM and run it in a web browser.

The game was originally written in my own programming language, [Owl](https://github.com/bsurmanski/wlc).
The original source code (in Owl) can be seen on github [here](https://github.com/bsurmanski/ggj2015).

## Controls

* Arrow Keys to move
* space to start

#### Art and Assets

All models were created in [Blender](http://blender.org/).

All textures were created in [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/).

All sound effects were created with [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html).

#### License
The game is licensed under the [MIT Open Source License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
